# Virtual-Air-Hockey
SOFTWARE PACKAGES REQUIRED--
install python 2.7
install openCV2

The aim of this project is to virtualise the air hockey game using a projector and infrared pointers. 
A projector is required to project the screen on table and then a camera scans the position of infrared pointer to give feedback to the screen for mallet location.
We are using openCV2 and working on PYTHON 2.7. 
Using Perspective image transformation, we would create a new virtual arena and then detect the movement by infrared LEDs, and the data would be used as a mouse pointer in the game running on computer.
The game has been made using simple vector kinematics.
2 PCs are required to execute this game. One for image procssing part, Second one to run tha game and project it on surface.
